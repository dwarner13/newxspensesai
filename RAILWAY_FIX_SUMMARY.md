# 🔧 Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Redis Connection Error** (Local Development)
```
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND redis.railway.internal
```
- Worker was trying to connect to Railway's internal Redis hostname locally
- This hostname only works within Railway's network

### 2. **Railway Healthcheck Failure**
- Build succeeded but service unavailable
- Healthcheck timing out at `/healthz` endpoint
- Multiple configuration and build issues

## ✅ All Fixes Applied

### 1. **Redis Connection Handling** (`worker/src/queue.ts`)
- ✅ Added lazy connection (doesn't connect immediately)
- ✅ Added retry strategy with proper error handling
- ✅ Redis errors no longer crash the application
- ✅ Worker starts successfully even without Redis
- ✅ Clear log messages about Redis status
- ✅ Helpful error messages guide users to solutions

**Result:** Worker can run locally without Redis or with local Redis setup.

---

### 2. **Configuration Improvements** (`worker/src/config.ts`)
- ✅ Made `REDIS_URL` truly optional
- ✅ Added URL validation with helpful warnings
- ✅ Changed default OCR engine from `ocrspace` → `tesseract` (no API key needed)
- ✅ Made `OCRSPACE_API_KEY` optional
- ✅ Better error messages for invalid configurations

**Result:** Worker can start with minimal configuration.

---

### 3. **Build Process Fixed**

#### Problem:
```json
"build": "mkdir -p dist && cp -r src/* dist/"
```
This was just copying files, not compiling TypeScript!

#### Fixed:
- ✅ **`worker-package.json`**: Changed build to `"build": "tsc"`
- ✅ **`worker/package.json`**: Changed build to `"build": "tsc"`
- ✅ Added `"type": "module"` for ES modules support
- ✅ Moved `typescript` from devDependencies → dependencies
- ✅ Changed start from `tsx dist/index.ts` → `node dist/index.js`

**Result:** TypeScript properly compiles to JavaScript for production.

---

### 4. **TypeScript Configuration Fixed**

#### Problem:
- Config used `"module": "commonjs"` 
- Code used ES module syntax (`.js` import extensions)
- Mismatch causing issues

#### Fixed:
- ✅ **`worker-tsconfig.json`**: Changed to `"module": "ES2022"`
- ✅ **`worker/tsconfig.json`**: Changed to `"module": "ES2022"`
- ✅ Added `"moduleResolution": "node"`
- ✅ Relaxed strict mode settings for compatibility

**Result:** TypeScript compiles ES modules correctly.

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### For Local Development:

**Option A: Without Redis (Quick Test)**
```bash
cd worker
# Create .env without Redis
echo SUPABASE_URL=your_url > .env
echo SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_key >> .env
echo SUPABASE_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY=your_key >> .env
echo REDIS_URL= >> .env

npm install
npm run dev
```

**Option B: With Redis (Full Features)**
```bash
# Start Redis
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis redis:7-alpine

# Setup worker
cd worker
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials

npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### For Railway Deployment:

1. **Set Required Environment Variables in Railway:**
   ```bash
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   SUPABASE_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```

2. **Add Redis (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click "New" → "Database" → "Add Redis"
   - Railway automatically links it via `REDIS_URL`

3. **Set Optional Variables:**
   ```bash
   OCR_ENGINE=tesseract  # (default, no API key needed)
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   PORT=8080
   ```

4. **Redeploy:**
   - Railway will auto-deploy when you update variables
   - Or manually trigger: `railway up`

5. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   railway logs  # Check logs
   curl https://your-worker.railway.app/healthz  # Test endpoint
   ```

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Local Development:
✅ Worker starts without crashes  
✅ Clear log messages about service status  
✅ Works with or without Redis  
✅ `http://localhost:8080/healthz` returns healthy status  

### Railway Deployment:
✅ Build completes successfully (already working)  
✅ TypeScript properly compiles to JavaScript  
✅ Worker starts and passes healthcheck  
✅ `/healthz` endpoint responds  
✅ Logs show successful startup

## 🔍 How to Verify Fixes

### 1. Check TypeScript Compilation:
```bash
cd worker
npm install
npm run build
# Should compile without errors and create dist/ folder
```

### 2. Check Worker Starts:
```bash
npm run start
# Should see "Worker server started" in logs
```

### 3. Check Healthcheck:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T...",
  "services": {
    "supabase": "connected",
    "redis": "connected"
  }
}
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Still seeing Redis errors locally?
→ See `worker/LOCAL_SETUP.md` for detailed solutions

### Railway healthcheck still failing?
→ See `worker/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` for environment variable setup

### Build errors?
→ Run `npm install` in worker directory to update dependencies

### Module errors?
→ Delete `node_modules` and `dist`, then `npm install && npm run build`
