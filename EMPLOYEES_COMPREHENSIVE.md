## 🚨 Conflicts & Duplicates

### Conflict 1: Slug Inconsistency (CRITICAL)

**Byte appears as**:
- `byte` in `src/config/ai-employees.js:33`
- `byte-doc` in database seed
- `smart-import` in `UniversalAIController.ts:72`

**Impact**: Routing fails, sessions don't match, tools not found

**Fix**: Standardize on `byte-doc` everywhere

---

### Conflict 2: Tag Slug Mismatch

**Tag appears as**:
- `tag` in `src/config/ai-employees.js:87`
- `tag-ai` in database seed
- `categorization` in `UniversalAIController.ts:124`

**Impact**: Same as Byte

**Fix**: Standardize on `tag-ai`

---

### Conflict 3: Multiple Prompt Sources

**Prime's prompt defined in**:
1. Database `employee_profiles.system_prompt` (authoritative)
2. `src/config/ai-employees.js:13-19` (identical copy)
3. `src/systems/AIEmployeeSystem.ts:50-56` (identical copy)

**Impact**: Updates must be synchronized across 3 locations

**Recommendation**: Database as single source of truth

---

### Conflict 4: Dynamic Prompt Generation

**UniversalAIController has methods**:
- `buildBytePrompt()` - Generates Byte's prompt dynamically
- `buildTagPrompt()` - Generates Tag's prompt
- `buildCrystalPrompt()` - Generates Crystal's prompt
- +12 more `build{Name}Prompt()` methods

**These OVERRIDE the static config prompts!**

**Impact**: Unclear which prompt is actually used at runtime

**Recommendation**: Deprecate dynamic generation, use database

---

### Ghost Employees

**In Code but NOT in Database**:
- crystal-analytics
- ledger-tax
- goalie-goals
- blitz-debt
- +20 more

**Impact**: Can't use centralized chat runtime (no DB entry)

**Fix**: Run SQL UPSERTs (provided below)

**In Database but NOT in Code**:
- None found

---

## 🔧 Ready-to-Run SQL

### List All Employees in Database

```sql

```

**Expected Output (current)**:
```

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Run SQL above** to add 4 missing employees to database
2. **Standardize slugs** across all files:
   - `byte` → `byte-doc`
   - `tag` → `tag-ai`
   - Add migration script for consistency
3. **Choose single source** for prompts (recommend: database)

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)

4. **Deprecate `build{Name}Prompt()` methods** in UniversalAIController
5. **Sync all prompts to database** as canonical source
6. **Add tools to employees** based on capabilities
7. **Create employee directory API** (`GET /api/employees`)

### Medium-term (Month 1-2)

8. **Activate partial employees** (Finley, Serenity, Wisdom, etc.)
9. **Write prompts for placeholders** (Roast team)
10. **Create employee admin UI** for prompt management

---
