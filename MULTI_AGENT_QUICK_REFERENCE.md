## 🎯 The Big Picture

### Before (Single-Agent)

```
User: "Process my receipt and find tax deductions"

User → Byte (upload receipt)
  Byte: "Done! But I can't help with tax. Try Ledger."
  
User → Ledger (manually switch)
  Ledger: "I need the receipt data. Upload to Byte first."
  
User: [frustrated] 😤
```

### After (Multi-Agent)

```
User: "Process my receipt and find tax deductions"

User → Prime (single conversation)
  Prime [internal]:
    → Byte: extract receipt → $45.99, Starbucks
    → Tag: categorize → Dining - Coffee  
    → Ledger: tax review → Not deductible (personal expense)
  Prime → User: "Done! Byte processed your receipt ($45.99 at Starbucks),
                   Tag categorized it as Dining, and Ledger reviewed it for
                   tax purposes. This is a personal expense, not deductible.
                   Any business meals I should analyze?"
                   
User: [delighted] 🎉
```

## 🚀 Quick Implementation

### Database (5 minutes)

```sql
-- 1. Add delegate tool
INSERT INTO tools_registry (name, purpose, handler_path, auth_scope)
VALUES ('delegate', 'Delegate to specialist', 'chat_runtime/tools/delegate.ts', 'service');

-- 2. Give Prime delegation power
UPDATE employee_profiles 
SET tools_allowed = array_append(tools_allowed, 'delegate')
WHERE slug = 'prime-boss';

-- 3. Add missing employees
INSERT INTO employee_profiles (slug, title, emoji, system_prompt, capabilities)
VALUES 
  ('crystal-analytics', 'Crystal', '💎', '[copy from config]', ARRAY['analysis']),
  ('ledger-tax', 'Ledger', '📊', '[copy from config]', ARRAY['tax']),
  ('goalie-goals', 'Goalie', '🥅', '[copy from config]', ARRAY['goals']),
  ('blitz-debt', 'Blitz', '⚡', '[copy from config]', ARRAY['debt']);
```

### Code (Already Done!)

- ✅ `chat_runtime/internal/agentBridge.ts` - Ready
- ✅ `chat_runtime/tools/delegate.ts` - Ready
- ⬜ Wire into `netlify/functions/chat.ts` - 30 min
- ⬜ Add tests - 2 hours

### Enable (Feature Flag)

```bash
# .env
ENABLE_DELEGATION=true  # Turn on delegation

# Or staged rollout
DELEGATION_BETA_PERCENT=10  # 10% of users
```

## 📊 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Delegation

```
Input: "Upload my receipt"
Expected: Prime → Byte (auto) → "Processed!"
Time: ~2s
```

### Scenario 2: Chain

```
Input: "Upload receipt and categorize it"
Expected: Prime → Byte → Tag → "Done! Categorized as Dining"
Time: ~4s
```

### Scenario 3: Parallel

```
Input: "Analyze everything about my finances"
Expected: Prime → [Crystal, Tag, Ledger] → Merged insights
Time: ~3s (parallel)
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Impact | Fix | Priority |
|-------|--------|-----|----------|
| **3 different slugs for Byte** | Routing fails | Standardize on `byte-doc` | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Prompts in 3 places** | Sync issues | Use database only | 🔴 HIGH |
| **4 employees not in DB** | Can't delegate to them | Run INSERT SQL | 🔴 HIGH |
| **No tool calling loop** | Tools don't execute | Add to Netlify function | 🟡 MED |
| **Empty RAG embeddings** | Retrieval returns nothing | Populate from receipts | 🟡 MED |
| **No auto-summarization** | Long convos hit token limit | Add trigger | 🟢 LOW |

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After rollout, track:

- **Delegation Rate**: % of Prime convos that delegate (target: >40%)
- **Success Rate**: Delegations that complete successfully (target: >95%)
- **User Satisfaction**: NPS improvement (target: +10 points)
- **Time Saved**: Average resolution time (target: -50%)
- **Token Efficiency**: Cost per conversation (target: <$0.03)
