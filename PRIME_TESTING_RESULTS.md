### Response Structure Validation

**Non-Tool Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "sessionId": "uuid-or-ephemeral",
  "messageUid": "message-id",
  "reply": "Prime's response here...",
  "employee": "prime-boss"
}
```
✅ Valid

**Tool-Call Response (when applicable):**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "messageUid": "msg-id",
  "reply": "Synthesis response after delegation...",
  "employee": "prime-boss",
  "hadToolCalls": true
}
```
✅ Structure ready for tool calls

## 📈 Performance Observations

| Test | Response Time | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Hello | <200ms | ✅ Fast |
| Analytics | ~200-300ms | ✅ Good |
| Delegation | ~200-300ms | ✅ Good |
| PII Protection | <200ms | ✅ Fast |

**Average Response Time**: ~200ms (without delegation execution)

## 📝 Known Behaviors

1. **Session ID Creation**: When sessionId not provided, ephemeral session created
2. **Memory Facts**: Optional - works when table exists, skips gracefully if not
3. **Analytics Context**: Aggregates last 3 months by category
4. **Pending Tasks**: Shows up to 5, ordered by due date
5. **Tool Calling**: Only happens when `nostream=1` and Prime decides to delegate
6. **PII Masking**: Applied before processing, guardrail warning shown

## 🔄 Test Reproducibility

To reproduce these tests locally:

```powershell
# Run comprehensive test suite
powershell -File test-prime-simple.ps1

# Or run individual curl commands
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/chat-v3-production?nostream=1' \
