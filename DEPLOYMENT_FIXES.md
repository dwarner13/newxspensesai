# Deployment Fixes for Netlify

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Vite Configuration
- **Problem**: `base: '/'` in vite.config.ts was causing absolute path issues
- **Solution**: Changed to `base: ''` for relative paths
- **File**: `vite.config.ts`

### 2. Netlify Configuration
- **Problem**: Missing proper SPA routing and security headers
- **Solution**: Enhanced netlify.toml with:
  - Force redirects for SPA routing
  - Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
  - Proper asset caching
- **File**: `netlify.toml`

### 3. Redirects
- **Problem**: Redirects file needed better formatting
- **Solution**: Updated `public/_redirects` with proper SPA routing
- **File**: `public/_redirects`

### 4. HTML Base Tag
- **Problem**: `<base href="/" />` was causing routing conflicts
- **Solution**: Removed the base tag from built HTML
- **File**: `dist/index.html` (auto-generated)

### 5. Cross-Platform Build Script
- **Problem**: Build script used Windows-only `copy` command, then Linux-only `cp` command
- **Solution**: Installed `copyfiles` package for cross-platform compatibility
- **Files**: `package.json` scripts, added `copyfiles` dependency

## Build Script Solution

The build script now uses `copyfiles` which works on both Windows and Linux:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rimraf dist && vite build && copyfiles public/_redirects dist/",
    "build:analyze": "rimraf dist && vite build --mode analyze && copyfiles public/_redirects dist/",
    "build:prod": "rimraf dist && vite build --mode production && copyfiles public/_redirects dist/"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "copyfiles": "^2.4.1"
  }
}
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Builds work on Windows (your local environment)
- ✅ Builds work on Linux (Netlify's build environment)
- ✅ `_redirects` file is properly copied to `dist` folder
- ✅ SPA routing works correctly after deployment

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `dist`
   - Deploy

3. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check that all routes work (not just the homepage)
   - Verify assets are loading correctly
   - Test navigation between pages

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Assets Not Loading
- Ensure `_redirects` file is copied to `dist` folder
- Check that asset paths use relative paths (`./assets/`) not absolute (`/assets/`)

### Routing Issues
- Verify `netlify.toml` has proper redirects
- Check that `_redirects` file is in the `dist` folder
- Ensure all routes redirect to `index.html`

### Build Failures
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript compilation errors

### Build Script Issues
- **Windows**: `copy` command not available
- **Linux**: `cp` command not available
- **Solution**: Use `copyfiles` package for cross-platform compatibility

## Testing Locally

1. **Build and preview**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Test with local server**:
   ```bash
   npx serve dist
   ```

## Environment Variables

If you need environment-specific configurations, create a `.env.production` file:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com
VITE_APP_ENV=production
```

## Troubleshooting

If the site still doesn't work:

1. Check Netlify build logs for errors
2. Verify the `dist` folder contains all necessary files
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Ensure all asset files are properly referenced
5. Test with a simple HTML file first to isolate the issue
6. Verify the build script completes successfully with exit code 0
