## 🧪 **TEST IT LOCALLY** (After SQL Migration)

### **Step 1: Run SQL Migration** (If not done yet)

Copy **SIMPLE_MIGRATION_RUN_THIS.sql** into Supabase SQL Editor and run it.

### **Step 2: Start Dev Server**

```bash
netlify dev
```

Wait for: `Server now ready on http://localhost:8888`

### **Step 3: Open Chat**

Visit: **http://localhost:8888/chat-test**

## 💬 **Test These Prompts**

### **Test 1: Recent Import Summary**

**Say**: "What did I upload recently?"

**Expected**:
```
🔧 Tool: getRecentImportSummary

Prime: "You recently uploaded receipt.jpg on October 13. 
I found 1 transaction from Starbucks for $4.50. 
Everything looks good - no review needed!"
```

### **Test 2: Query Transactions**

**Say**: "How much did I spend at Starbucks last month?"

**Expected**:
```
🔧 Tool: getTransactions({ vendor: "Starbucks", from: "2024-09-01", to: "2024-09-30" })

Prime: "You spent $15.75 at Starbucks last month across 3 transactions."
```

### **Test 3: Gmail Search** (If Gmail connected)

**Say**: "Find my latest Visa statement"

**Expected**:
```
🔧 Tool: searchEmail({ query: "visa statement", days: 90 })

Prime: "I found your September Visa Statement from Sept 28 (score: 88). 
Would you like me to import it?"

User: "Yes"

🔧 Tool: fetchAttachments({ messageId: "msg-123" })

Prime: "Done! I've queued your Visa statement for processing. 
You'll get a notification in about 30 seconds when the 
transactions are imported."
```

### **Test 4: Review Needed**

**Say**: "Do I have anything that needs review?"

**Expected**:
```
🔧 Tool: getNeedsReview({ limit: 50 })

Prime: "You have 2 transactions that need review:
1. $45.50 from 'Unknown Merchant' on Oct 10 (no category)
2. $12.00 from 'ABC Shop' on Oct 12 (low confidence)

Would you like help categorizing them?"
```

## 📊 **How to Verify It's Working**

### **In Browser Console**:

Look for these logs:
```
📝 Note: Using tools...
🔧 Tool executing: searchEmail
✅ Tool complete: searchEmail {...}
```

### **In Netlify Dev Terminal**:

Look for:
```
[Tool] Executing searchEmail { query: "visa statement", days: 90 }
[Tool Search] Found 3 candidates
```

### **In Database**:

```sql
-- Check recent tool usage (when we add logging)
SELECT * FROM chat_messages WHERE role = 'assistant' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
-- Should show messages with tool context
```

## 🎉 **What This Unlocks**

### **Before (Without Tools)**:

**User**: "Find my bank statements"  
**Prime**: "I can help you with that! Go to Gmail and search for statements, then upload them to our app..."  
**Result**: 😞 Generic advice, no action

### **After (With Tools)**:

**User**: "Find my bank statements"  
**Prime**: "🔧 Searching your Gmail..."  
**Prime**: "I found 3 bank statements: TD Sept ($2,341.50), RBC Aug ($1,892.23), TD Jul ($2,103.45). Would you like me to import all of them?"  
**User**: "Yes"  
**Prime**: "🔧 Processing 3 statements..."  
**Prime**: "Done! Imported 47 transactions. 3 need your review."  
**Result**: 🎉 **ACTUAL WORK DONE**
