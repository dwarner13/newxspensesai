# ⚡ Quick Fix Checklist

## ✅ What I Fixed (Already Done)

- ✅ Redis connection handling (won't crash locally)
- ✅ TypeScript build configuration (proper compilation)
- ✅ ES modules setup
- ✅ Made OCR API key optional (uses Tesseract by default)
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Updated all package.json files
- ✅ Updated all tsconfig files
- ✅ Created deployment documentation

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Now

### For Railway Deployment (Main Issue):

#### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Railway
Go to your Railway project → Worker service → Variables tab and add:

**Required:**
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...your_key
SUPABASE_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...your_key
```

**Optional but Recommended - Add Redis:**
- Click "New" in Railway dashboard
- Select "Database" → "Add Redis"
- Railway auto-configures `REDIS_URL`

#### Step 2: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Railway deployment - TypeScript build, Redis handling, env config"
git push
```

Railway will automatically redeploy.

#### Step 3: Verify
```bash
railway logs
```

Look for:
- ✅ "Worker server started"
- ✅ "Redis connected successfully" (if Redis added)
- ✅ No "ENOTFOUND" errors

Test healthcheck:
```bash
curl https://your-worker.railway.app/healthz
```

### For Local Development (Optional):

**Without Redis (Quick Test):**
```bash
cd worker
npm install
npm run dev
```

**With Redis (Full Features):**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Redis
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Terminal 2: Start Worker
cd worker
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📚 Documentation Reference

- **Local Setup Issues?** → Read `worker/LOCAL_SETUP.md`
- **Railway Deployment?** → Read `worker/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- **Complete Summary?** → Read `RAILWAY_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

---

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

### Before (The Problem):
❌ Local: `Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND redis.railway.internal`  
❌ Railway: Healthcheck failing, service unavailable  

### After (Fixed):
✅ Local: Worker starts successfully  
✅ Railway: Healthcheck passes, service healthy  
✅ Clear error messages guide you to solutions

## ⏰ Time Estimate

- Set Railway env vars: **2 minutes**
- Commit & push: **1 minute**
- Wait for Railway redeploy: **2-3 minutes**
- Verify deployment: **1 minute**

**Total: ~5-7 minutes** 🚀

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

**Local: Still seeing Redis errors?**
```bash
# Option 1: Run without Redis
$env:REDIS_URL=""
npm run dev

# Option 2: Start local Redis
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
npm run dev
```

**Railway: Healthcheck still failing?**
1. Check logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify all 3 Supabase env vars are set
3. Make sure values don't have extra spaces
4. Try restarting: `railway restart`

**Build errors?**
```bash
cd worker
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install
npm run build
```
