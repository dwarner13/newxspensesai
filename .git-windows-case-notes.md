# Windows Git Case Sensitivity Notes

## Issue
Windows filesystem is case-insensitive, but Git tracks case-sensitive paths. This can cause issues where Git shows a file as modified even when you haven't changed it, especially when paths differ only by case.

## Current Configuration
```bash
git config core.ignorecase
# Output: true
```

**Status:** `core.ignorecase` is set to `true`, which is correct for Windows.

## Common Problem
If you see a file like `src/components/Analytics/AnalyticsUnifiedCard.tsx` showing as modified when you haven't touched it, it may be a case-sensitivity issue.

## Solution
If a file shows as modified but shouldn't be included in your commit:

```bash
# Mark the file as assume-unchanged (temporary, per-working-tree)
git update-index --assume-unchanged src/components/Analytics/AnalyticsUnifiedCard.tsx

# If multiple case variants exist:
git update-index --assume-unchanged src/components/analytics/AnalyticsUnifiedCard.tsx

# Verify it's ignored:
git status
```

**Note:** `--assume-unchanged` is a local-only flag. It doesn't affect other developers or the remote repository.

## To Unignore Later
```bash
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged src/components/Analytics/AnalyticsUnifiedCard.tsx
```

## Best Practice
- Keep `core.ignorecase = true` on Windows
- Use `--assume-unchanged` for temporary WIP files that shouldn't be committed
- Commit actual changes separately from hotfixes
