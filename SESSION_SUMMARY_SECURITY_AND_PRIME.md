## 🤴 Initiative 2: Prime Intelligence Audit & Modernization Plan (Complete)

### What Was Delivered

Comprehensive audit of Prime's current logic with detailed modernization plan:

**File:** `PRIME_INTELLIGENCE_AUDIT_AND_MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md` (800+ lines)

### Current State Analysis (Exactly Mapped)

#### **Where Prime is Defined (5 Locations)**

1. **`src/systems/AIEmployeeSystem.ts:42-69`** - Basic registry
   - Static personality, no personalization
   - Hard-coded tone and phrases
   - No memory integration

2. **`src/components/boss/BossBubble.tsx:119-307`** - Dashboard chat
   - Same greeting for all users
   - No first-run detection
   - No contextual memory loading

3. **`src/systems/AIEmployeeOrchestrator.ts:46-105`** - Routing logic
   - Brittle keyword matching
   - No confidence scoring
   - No multi-employee routing

4. **`chat_runtime/contextBuilder.ts:28-235`** - Context assembly
   - Gets facts, history, RAG context
   - Missing: user segmentation, adaptive greeting, handoff metrics

5. **`src/utils/userMemory.ts:1-298`** - User data available but unused
   - Has `lastActive`, `trustLevel`, `conversationHistory`
   - Prime doesn't load or use any of this

### 10 Critical Gaps Identified

| Gap | Impact | Severity | Solution |
|-----|--------|----------|----------|
| No user segmentation | Same greeting for all | 🔴 Critical | Add 8-tier segmentation system |
| No memory of Prime interactions | No learning across sessions | 🔴 Critical | Track Prime-specific history |
| No first-run detection | No onboarding flow | 🔴 Critical | Detect new users |
| No personality adaptation | Tone never changes | 🟡 High | Adapt based on segment |
| No context from past handoffs | Repeats failed routing | 🟡 High | Track handoff success metrics |
| No power user recognition | Talks to experts like beginners | 🟡 High | Adjust communication level |
| No proactive suggestions | Reactive only | 🟡 High | Generate suggestions |
| No multi-step task awareness | Inefficient employee chaining | 🟠 Medium | Add sequential routing |
| No financial context enrichment | Generic advice | 🟠 Medium | Enrich with user's situation |
| No handoff success metrics | Can't improve routing | 🟠 Medium | Add feedback loop |

### 5 Modernization Modules Proposed

#### **Module 1: User Segmentation (NEW)**
```typescript
src/lib/prime/userSegmentation.ts
```
8-tier user segmentation:
- `new` - First visit ever
- `onboarding` - Days 1-7
- `active` - 2+ times/week, >2 weeks
- `power_user` - 20+ interactions, high success
- `inactive` - No activity > 30 days
- `churning` - Declining activity
- `vip` - Completed major goals
- `learner` - Many "how-to" questions

#### **Module 2: Adaptive Greeting (NEW)**
```typescript
src/lib/prime/adaptiveGreeting.ts
```
Segment-specific greetings:
- New users: Welcome + team intro
- Power users: Acknowledge expertise + offer advanced
- VIPs: Celebrate achievement
- Inactive: Re-engagement with relevance
- Churning: Recovery with empathy

#### **Module 3: Intelligent Routing (NEW)**
```typescript
src/lib/prime/intelligentRouting.ts
```
Multi-factor scoring:
- 40% intent match
- 30% past success rate
- 20% user level compatibility
- 10% recency boost
- Result: confidence + reasoning + sequential chain

#### **Module 4: Rich Context (NEW)**
```typescript
src/lib/prime/richContext.ts
```
Memory-aware context building:
- Adaptive greeting
- User memory facts (10 pinned)
- Handoff success metrics
- Financial context
- Communication style
- Segment-specific instructions

#### **Module 5: Proactive Suggestions (NEW)**
```typescript
src/lib/prime/proactiveSuggestions.ts
```
Intelligence-driven suggestions:
- Goal progress alerts
- Spending anomaly detection
- Segment-specific learning paths
- Feature discovery

### 5-Phase Implementation Roadmap

| **Phase 4** | Week 7-8 | Proactivity | Anomaly detection, suggestions |
| **Phase 5** | Week 9-10 | Testing | A/B tests, feedback loops |

### 7 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Routing Accuracy | ~65% | 85%+ | Successful handoff / total |
| User Satisfaction | Unknown | 4.5/5 | Post-handoff surveys |
| Handoff Completion | ~70% | 85%+ | Task completion rate |
| Return Rate | Unknown | 45%+ | 7-day return rate |
| Engagement by Segment | N/A | Tracked | Interactions per segment |
| Power User Growth | ~5% | 15%+ | Users in power_user segment |
| Churn Recovery | N/A | 20% | Inactive users re-engaging |

## 📊 Current Implementation Flow vs. Proposed Flow

### Current Prime Greeting Flow (Static)

```
User Opens Dashboard
    ↓
[Load BossBubble component]
    ↓
[createSystemPrompt() - ALWAYS SAME]
    ↓
User sees generic greeting regardless of:
  • Day 1 vs. day 365
  • Success/failure history
  • Personality preference
  • Financial goals
  • Prior interactions
```

### Proposed Prime Greeting Flow (Intelligent)

```
User Opens Dashboard
    ↓
[Load BossBubble component]
    ↓
[Segment user (new/active/power_user/etc)]
    ↓
[Load adaptive greeting for segment]
    ↓
[Load memory facts + handoff metrics]
    ↓
[Enrich with financial context]
    ↓
[Assemble segment-specific system prompt]
    ↓
User sees personalized greeting based on:
  ✅ User tenure & activity
  ✅ Success/failure patterns
  ✅ Communication preference
  ✅ Financial goals & progress
  ✅ Past interactions with Prime
```

## 🎯 Quick Reference: What Gets Built Next

### To Get Started Immediately

```typescript
// Step 1: Create segmentation system
src/lib/prime/userSegmentation.ts              // 150 lines
  → Detect: new, onboarding, active, power_user, inactive, churning, vip, learner

// Step 2: Create adaptive greetings
src/lib/prime/adaptiveGreeting.ts              // 200 lines
  → Generate segment-specific greetings

// Step 3: Integrate into BossBubble
src/components/boss/BossBubble.tsx             // UPDATE
  → Replace hard-coded greeting with adaptive greeting

// Step 4: Track metrics
supabase migrations:
  → Add user_segments table
  → Add prime_interactions table
  → Add handoff_metrics table
```

### Database Additions Needed

```sql
-- New tables
CREATE TABLE user_segments (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  segment UserSegment,
  confidence FLOAT,
  daysActive INT,
  interactionCount INT,
  handoffSuccessRate FLOAT,
  communicationPreference TEXT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

CREATE TABLE prime_interactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  segment UserSegment,
  greeting TEXT,
  routing_decision JSONB,
  outcome VARCHAR(20), -- 'success', 'failed', 'incomplete'
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ
);

CREATE TABLE handoff_metrics (
  user_id UUID,
  from_employee VARCHAR,
  to_employee VARCHAR,
  success BOOLEAN,
  completion_rate FLOAT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

## ❓ Key Questions to Answer

Before starting Phase 1, decide on:

1. **Segmentation Timing:**
   - Real-time calculation (every request)?
   - Periodic (daily batch)?
   - On-demand (triggered by event)?

2. **Memory Budget:**
   - How many facts to load (5? 10? 20)?
   - How many metrics to track?
   - Context token limit?

3. **Routing Strategy:**
   - Use embeddings-based (expensive but accurate)?
   - Use heuristics/rules (cheap but brittle)?
   - Hybrid approach?

4. **Segment Transitions:**
   - Should users move segments mid-session?
   - Or lock segment for session?
   - Or recalculate every N requests?

5. **Token Budget:**
   - How many tokens for Prime's full context?
   - Priority: Greeting, Facts, or Routing?
