# Analytics Enhancements - Complete

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**

---

## 🎯 Overview

Three major analytics enhancements have been added to improve spending insights for both Prime and Crystal:

1. **Smart Filtering** - Income and refund exclusion
2. **Top Spend Drivers** - New analytics computation
3. **Enhanced Personas** - Data-driven specialization

---

## 📊 Enhancement 1: Smart Filtering in Spending Trends

### What Changed

**Before**: Only checked if `amount < 0`
```typescript
if (amt < 0) continue;
```

**After**: Intelligent filtering with category and type awareness
```typescript
const isIncome = String(t.category || "").toLowerCase() === "income";
const isRefundLike = amt < 0 || String(t.type || "").toLowerCase() === "credit";
if (isIncome || isRefundLike) continue;
```

### Benefits

- ✅ Excludes income transactions (false expenses)
- ✅ Filters refunds and credits properly
- ✅ Accounts for both `type` and `amount` fields
- ✅ More accurate expense calculations

### Example

```
Raw data:
- Income $3500 (should be excluded)
- Purchase $45.99 (include)
- Refund -$15.00 (exclude)
- Credit type: $20 (exclude)

Result: $45.99 expense only
```

## 🚀 Enhancement 2: Top Spend Drivers Function

### What's New

**New Function**: `dbComputeTopSpendDrivers()`

```typescript
async function dbComputeTopSpendDrivers(
  userId: string,
  days: number = ANALYTICS_LOOKBACK_DAYS,  // 90 days
  groupBy: "category" | "merchant" = "category",
  topN: number = 3
)
```

### Features

- ✅ Dynamic date column detection (same as trends)
- ✅ Configurable grouping (category or merchant)
- ✅ Top N results (default: 3)
- ✅ Lookback period in days (default: 90)
- ✅ Returns aggregated totals + percentage

### Output Format

```typescript
{
  lines: ["1. Groceries: $450.32", "2. Dining: $285.10", "3. Utilities: $180.55"],
  total: $915.97,
  meta: { sinceIso: "2025-07-18T..." }
}
```

### Smart Filtering

Same income/refund filtering as trends:
```typescript
- Excludes income category transactions
- Excludes refund-like transactions (negative amount or type='credit')
- Only sums real expenses
```

---

## 👥 Enhancement 3: Enhanced Personas

### Prime's Analytics

Prime now receives **both**:
1. Monthly trends (readable format)
2. Top spend drivers (actionable insights)

```
## ANALYTICS CONTEXT (last 3 mo)
- Oct 2025 — Total: $1,250 | Top: Groceries: $450, Dining: $285, Utilities: $180

## ANALYTICS: TOP SPEND DRIVERS (last 3 mo)
1. Groceries: $450.32
2. Dining: $285.10
3. Utilities: $180.55
Total analyzed expenses: $915.97
```

### Crystal's Enhanced Persona

**Before**: Generic specialist
```
"You are Crystal, expert in analytics, KPIs, and insights."
```

**After**: Data-driven, actionable insights expert
```
"You are Crystal, a precise, data-driven spending insights specialist. 
You analyze transactions, identify top spend drivers, and explain changes 
in plain English. Prefer concise, numeric summaries and practical next actions."
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### New Constant

```typescript
const ANALYTICS_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 90;  // 3 months
```

Used by:
- `dbComputeTopSpendDrivers()` as default lookback
- Configuration is centralized

### Date Column Detection

Both functions use identical probing logic:

```typescript
const DATE_CANDIDATES = [
  "posted_at",        // Primary (most common)
  "transaction_date", // Alternative
  "booked_at",        // Bank booking date
  "occurred_at",      // Transaction occurrence
  "date",             // Generic fallback
  "created_at"        // Fallback
];
```

Benefits:
- ✅ Works with different schemas
- ✅ Gracefully skips analytics if column not found
- ✅ Efficient probing (checks one row only)

### Type Safety

All database reads use `as any[]` casting for dynamic columns:
```typescript
for (const t of data as any[]) {
  const amt = Number(t.amount) || 0;
  const category = String(t.category || "").toLowerCase();
  const raw = t[chosenCol];  // Dynamic column access
  // ...
}
```
