# 🗄️ Supabase Migration Guide - AI Employee System

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Option 1: Manual Migration (Recommended)**

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy and Paste the Migration**
   - Copy the entire content from: `supabase/migrations/20241201000000_create_ai_employees_system.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL editor

4. **Run the Migration**
   - Click "Run" button
   - Wait for completion (should take 10-30 seconds)

5. **Verify the Tables**
   - Go to "Table Editor" in the left sidebar
   - You should see these new tables:
     - `ai_employee_configs`
     - `ai_conversations`
     - `user_ai_preferences`
     - `ai_interactions_log`

### **Option 2: Using Supabase CLI (If you have project access)**

If you have your Supabase project reference, you can run:

```bash
# Link your project (replace with your project ref)
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Push the migration
npx supabase db push
```

### **🎯 What This Migration Creates:**

#### **Tables:**
- **`ai_employee_configs`** - Each AI employee's "brain" and settings
- **`ai_conversations`** - Conversation history for each user per employee
- **`user_ai_preferences`** - User preferences per AI employee
- **`ai_interactions_log`** - Analytics and interaction tracking

#### **AI Employees Created:**
- **Personal Finance AI:** Finley, Byte, Goalie, Crystal, Tag, Liberty, Chime
- **Wellness/Audio:** Luna, The Roundtable, Wave
- **Business/Tax/Automation:** Ledger, Intelia, Automa, Dash, Prism

#### **Features:**
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ✅ Database indexes for performance
- ✅ Helper functions for common operations
- ✅ Automatic timestamp updates
- ✅ All 15 AI employees pre-configured

### **🔍 Verification Steps:**

After running the migration, you can verify it worked by running this query in the SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'ai_%';

-- Check if AI employees were created
SELECT employee_key, name, emoji 
FROM ai_employee_configs 
ORDER BY name;
```

### **🚀 Next Steps:**

Once the migration is complete, we can:
1. **Build individual AI employee pages** with their own chat interfaces
2. **Test the AI employee system** with real conversations
3. **Enhance Prime's routing** to work with the new system

### **❓ Need Help?**

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Supabase dashboard for error messages
2. Make sure you have the correct permissions
3. Try running the migration in smaller chunks if needed
