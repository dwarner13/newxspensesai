## 🎯 WHAT ARE WE TESTING?

✅ **Feature Flags** — Control Crystal's context layers  
✅ **Employee Badge** — Show which AI is active  
✅ **Chat Component** — Send/receive messages  
✅ **Auto-Handoff** — Finance queries route to Crystal

## ⚡ QUICK START (5 minutes)

### 1. Start Development Server

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd C:\Users\user\Desktop\project-bolt-fixed
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
◈ Netlify Dev ◈
◈ Loaded function chat-v3-production
◈ Ready on http://localhost:8888
```

### 2. Run Automated Tests

```bash
# Terminal 2 (in same directory)
.\QUICK_TEST_SCRIPT.ps1
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ PASS — Endpoint is reachable
✅ PASS — Response received in 245ms
✅ PASS — Finance intent detected
✅ PASS — Crystal responded in 180ms
✅ PASS — History working (multi-turn context preserved)
✅ PASS — Performance acceptable

🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED! Ready for deployment.
```

## 📖 DETAILED TESTING (15-30 minutes)

If you want to test each feature manually:

### Test 1: Basic Chat Message

```powershell
$body = @{
  userId = "test-user-1"
  message = "Hi Prime, who are you?"
  employeeSlug = "prime-boss"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/chat-v3-production" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{"Content-Type" = "application/json"} `
  -Body $body
```

**Expected:** Response from Prime about his role

---

### Test 2: Auto-Handoff

```powershell
$body = @{
  userId = "test-user-2"
  message = "Show my spending trends"
  employeeSlug = "prime-boss"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/chat-v3-production" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{"Content-Type" = "application/json"} `
  -Body $body
```

**Expected:** Response with financial analysis (Crystal handles it)

---

### Test 3: Feature Flags

Update `.env.local`:
```bash
# Test Full Context
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_FACTS=1
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_HISTORY=1
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_ANALYTICS=1
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_BUDGETS=1
```

Restart `npm run dev` and test. Response should include facts, history, analytics, budgets.

Then change to:
```bash
# Test Analytics Only (faster)
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_FACTS=0
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_HISTORY=0
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_ANALYTICS=1
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_BUDGETS=0
```

Restart and test again. Response should be faster (~100-200ms vs 300ms).

## 🔧 DEBUGGING

### Problem: Endpoint not found

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
npm run dev

# Check it's on http://localhost:8888
```

### Problem: Slow responses

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reduce context layers in .env.local
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_FACTS=0
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_HISTORY=0
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_ANALYTICS=1
CRYSTAL_CONTEXT_BUDGETS=0

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Problem: Empty responses

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check database connection
# Verify SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in .env.local

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```
