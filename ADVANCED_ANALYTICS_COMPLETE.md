# Advanced Analytics Enhancements - Complete

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**

---

## 🎯 Overview

Three advanced analytics enhancements have been added for intelligent spending insights:

1. **Month-over-Month Analysis** - Track category spending changes
2. **Smart Suggestions** - Actionable recommendations based on patterns
3. **Enhanced Crystal Persona** - Data-driven insights specialist

---

## 📊 Enhancement 1: New Configuration Constants

### Purpose
Centralized thresholds for analytics filtering and alerting

### Constants Added

```typescript
const MOM_MIN_CATEGORY_TOTAL = 50;    // Ignore tiny categories (< $50)
const MOM_ALERT_THRESHOLD = 0.2;      // Alert on 20% change
const SUGGESTION_MIN_DELTA = 75;      // Suggest if $75+ delta
```

### Usage

**MOM_MIN_CATEGORY_TOTAL = 50**
- Filters out negligible expense categories
- Only shows categories with ≥ $50 in either month
- Reduces noise from one-off expenses
- Makes reports cleaner and more actionable

**MOM_ALERT_THRESHOLD = 0.2**
- 20% means both increases and decreases are flagged
- 20% increase: $100 → $120 (flagged)
- 20% decrease: $100 → $80 (flagged)
- Configurable for sensitivity tuning

**SUGGESTION_MIN_DELTA = 75**
- Only generates suggestions for changes ≥ $75
- Avoids micro-recommendations
- Focuses on meaningful improvements
- Threshold: 75 / 100 = 75% of base

## 🚀 Enhancement 2: Month-over-Month Analysis

### New Function: `dbComputeMoMByCategory()`

```typescript
async function dbComputeMoMByCategory(
  userId: string,
  months: number = 3
) → {
  lines: string[];           // Formatted movers
  items: Array<{             // Raw data
    category: string;
    prev: number;
    curr: number;
    delta: number;
    pct: number;
  }>;
  months: string[];          // [prev_month, curr_month]
  meta: { sinceIso: string };
}
```

### Features

✅ **Dynamic Date Detection** - Finds usable date column
✅ **Smart Filtering** - Excludes income & refunds
✅ **Month Grouping** - Aggregates by YYYY-MM
✅ **Significance Filtering** - Min $50 category total
✅ **Alert Triggering** - Shows 20%+ changes only
✅ **Change Ranking** - Sorted by absolute delta
✅ **Bidirectional** - Shows increases (↑) and decreases (↓)

### Example Output

```
## ANALYTICS: MONTH-OVER-MONTH MOVERS (2025-09 → 2025-10)
- Dining: ↑ $85.50 (45%) — 2025-09→2025-10 $190.00 → $275.50
- Software: ↓ $50.00 (-25%) — 2025-09→2025-10 $200.00 → $150.00
- Transport: ↑ $65.25 (35%) — 2025-09→2025-10 $186.50 → $251.75
```

### Data Processing

```
1. Fetch transactions for last 3 months
2. Group by YYYY-MM + category
3. Exclude: income, refunds, credits
4. Calculate prev month total, curr month total
5. Compute delta ($) and percentage (%)
6. Filter by MOM_MIN_CATEGORY_TOTAL (≥$50)
7. Alert if |pct| ≥ MOM_ALERT_THRESHOLD (20%)
8. Sort by |delta|, then |pct|
9. Return top 5 movers
```

## 💡 Enhancement 3: Suggested Actions

### New Function: `buildSuggestedActions()`

```typescript
function buildSuggestedActions(params: {
  topDrivers?: { lines: string[]; total: number };
  mom?: { 
    items: Array<{...}>;
    months: string[];
  };
  businessHint?: string;  // e.g., "bakery"
}) → string[]
```

### Smart Heuristics by Category

**Software/SaaS/Subscriptions**
```
Suggestion: Review active subscriptions and cancel unused seats.
Context: High recurring cost category
```

**Dining/Meals/Entertainment**
```
Suggestion: Set a monthly budget and create a rule to tag vendors like Starbucks consistently.
Context: Highly variable, benefit from tagging rules
```

**Transport/Fuel/Ride-Share**
```
Suggestion: Consider monthly passes or mileage tracking to optimize costs.
Context: Often reduced with transit plans
```

**Food/Inventory (for bakery/restaurant)**
```
Suggestion: Negotiate bulk rates with suppliers and schedule a re-order cadence.
Context: Business-specific optimization
```

**Generic Fallback**
```
Suggestion: Add a budget limit and monitor deviations; create a categorization rule for consistency.
Context: General best practice
```

### Features

✅ **Category Pattern Matching** - Regex-based detection
✅ **Business Context** - Adjusts suggestions for "bakery", "cafe", etc.
✅ **Deduplication** - No duplicate suggestions per category
✅ **Significance Filter** - Only $75+ deltas
✅ **Max 5 Suggestions** - Avoids overwhelming user
✅ **Actionable Wording** - Specific next steps

### Example Suggestions

```
## SUGGESTED ACTIONS
• **Dining**: increase of $85.50 MoM. Set a monthly budget and create a rule to tag vendors like Starbucks consistently.
• **Transport**: increase of $65.25 MoM. Consider monthly passes or mileage tracking to optimize costs.
