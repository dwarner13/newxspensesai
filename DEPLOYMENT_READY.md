```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Local Testing (localhost:8888)

```bash
# Test security utilities
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/tag-categorize \
  -H "x-user-id: test-user-123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"merchant_name": "Starbucks", "transaction_id": "tx-123"}'

# Expected response:
# { "ok": true, "category_id": "...", "confidence": 0.85, "source": "similarity" }
```

### Browser Testing

```
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in with test account
3. Verify:
   - Dashboard loads
   - Transactions display
   - Category suggestions appear
   - Chat opens (Prime)
   - Notifications bell works
```

## 📦 Files Changed This Session

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `tag-batch-categorize.ts` | Fixed import | ✅ |
| `tag-export-corrections.ts` | Fixed import | ✅ |
| `tag-why.ts` | Fixed import | ✅ |

## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Locally
```bash
# Terminal 1: Dev server (already running)
# Monitor: http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/health

# Terminal 2: Test functions
npm run test:functions  # or manual curl tests
```

### Step 2: Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
# Verify no TypeScript errors
# Verify all imports resolve
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve supabaseAdmin import paths + add production docs"
git push origin main
# Netlify auto-deploys
```

### Step 4: Monitor Production
```bash
netlify logs --tail
# Watch for:
# - No 404 errors for functions
# - No import errors
# - Categorization working
# - Workers running on schedule
```

## 📊 Success Metrics (Post-Deploy)

| Metric | Target | How to Check |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Build Status | ✅ Pass | Netlify dashboard |
| Functions | All available | `/.netlify/functions/health` |
| Error Rate | <1% | Netlify logs |
| Latency (non-AI) | <200ms p95 | Netlify analytics |
| Latency (AI) | <3s p95 | Netlify analytics |

## 🔍 Monitoring Dashboard

After deployment, monitor:

```sql
-- Daily stats
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  source,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM transaction_categorization
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at), source;

-- Error rate
SELECT 
  to_employee,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) as error_rate
FROM employee_tasks
WHERE updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY to_employee;

-- Performance
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (processed_at - created_at)) as duration_sec,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM employee_tasks
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND processed_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (processed_at - created_at));
```
