- Memory personalization and recall
- 3-layer security guardrails

**Impact**: Prime now acts as user's financial cofounder, not just assistant

### 2. Delegation System ✅

**What**: Smart delegation to specialists via OpenAI function calling

**Specialists**:
- 🔵 **Byte** (byte-docs) - Document OCR & processing

**Tool Definition**: `delegate` function with auto-detection of when to delegate

**Impact**: Prime intelligently decides between direct answers vs. delegation

### 3. Context Enrichment ✅

**For Prime** (4 context types):
- 📝 Last 20 conversation messages
- 🧠 Top 20 memory facts
- 📊 3-month spending trends
- 📋 Pending tasks (top 5)

- 90-day lookback (configurable)

**Impact**: More accurate spending analysis + actionable insights

### 5. Enhanced Personas ✅

**Crystal**: Now data-driven, actionable insights specialist

**Example Outputs**:
```
Prime: "I'll analyze your spending with our specialist Crystal..."
Crystal: "Your top 3 expense categories are Groceries, Dining, Utilities..."
```

**Impact**: More specialized, role-appropriate responses

### 6. Database Resilience ✅

**Dynamic Column Detection**:
- Tries 6 date column options
- Gracefully skips if none found
- Works with different schemas
- Efficient probing (limit 1)

**Impact**: Works with different database structures
